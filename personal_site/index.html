                <h2>I discovered my love for woodworking at the age of 13, and since then, that passion has only grown stronger. Throughout high school, I took multiple courses that helped me develop my skills and deepen my understanding of the craft. Beyond the classroom, I earned various certifications and honed my abilities through countless projects for friends and family. Each project has been an opportunity to learn, create, and share my love for woodworking with those around me.

Shout out to my dad. He taught me to draw a good line, make a square cut, and drill a straight hole. If it weren't for his generousity in letting me turn his shed into a woodshop this wouldn't have been possible.
